# weather_app
In this project, I tried to implement my knowledge of APIs and hereby, I built a weather app

A simple and clean command-line weather application built with Python that displays current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

Perfect for learning API integration, JSON handling, and building practical CLI tools!

## Features ✨
- Current weather: temperature, feels like, humidity, wind speed, and description
- 5-day forecast with daily summaries
- User-friendly output with emojis
- Error handling for invalid cities or API issues
- Easy to run and extend
